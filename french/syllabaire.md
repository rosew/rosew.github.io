# Le Syllabaire

## Introduction

These French lessons are based on "Le Syllabaire" published in England as part of "The Royal School Series". I have expanded on the original text to add the guidance needed for an independent learner. Additional content will include pronunciation advice, English translations, and general comments on the difference between French and English.

Please note, this is being written as I learn French to create my own notes. There may be mistakes. My goal is to create a resource that teaches French rules as needed to allow students to read simple French stories and writing. It can either be used by an adult for self study or as training so they can teach a student.

### Un
Our first French word is **un**. When introducing new words we will provide the following information:

* The word with the pronunciation using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) in () after the spelling.

[un](https://translate.google.com/#fr/en/un) (&#339;&#771;)
: one / a

**un** is pronounced with a nasal sound that is not part of the English language. Nasal vowels will be marked in our IPA with a ~ after the vowel. Here is a good Youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI2Pso1dDjM) on French Pronunciation. I recommend watching the entire video. If you just want to focus on saying nasal vowels then jump to minute 8:08.
